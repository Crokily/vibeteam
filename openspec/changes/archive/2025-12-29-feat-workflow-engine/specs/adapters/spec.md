## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Non-Intrusive State Monitoring
The system SHALL monitor the CLI session state without interfering with the visual terminal output AND without writing raw output to the parent process stdout.

#### Scenario: Tool Approval Hint
- **WHEN** the underlying CLI outputs a tool confirmation prompt
- **THEN** the system detects this state change via the observer
- **AND** emits an event for the UI
- **AND** prevents the raw prompt from leaking to the main process stdout
