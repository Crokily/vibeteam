## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: PTY Process Management
The system SHALL provide an `AgentRunner` capable of managing subprocesses via a pseudo-terminal.

#### Scenario: Lifecycle Management
- **WHEN** the runner is started with a valid adapter
- **THEN** it spawns a shell process
- **AND** maintains a persistent TTY session until stopped

#### Scenario: Bi-directional Communication
- **WHEN** text is sent to the runner
- **THEN** it is written to the subprocess standard input
- **AND** subprocess output is captured and emitted as events

### Requirement: Agent Adapter Interface
The system SHALL define an `IAgentAdapter` contract to normalize interactions with diverse CLI tools.

#### Scenario: Launch Configuration
- **WHEN** an adapter is queried for launch config
- **THEN** it returns the specific command and arguments (e.g., `['gemini', 'chat']`)

### Requirement: Output Sanitization
The system SHALL provide utilities to process raw terminal output.

#### Scenario: ANSI Stripping
- **WHEN** raw output containing ANSI colors/cursor codes is received
- **THEN** a clean, text-only version is generated for programmatic analysis
